#  PROBLEM-SOLVING SOLUTIONS PROJECT

## Motives and Goals: 
1. As a recent Math grad, I want to land in more technical interviews and 
   get great offers, especially from the FAANG and big tech companies
2. I plan to work on 5 LeetCode and 5 HackerRank problem per day 
3. Doing this project not only keeps me disciplined adn committed but also 
   hone my data structure and algorithm skills. 
<br />
As Thomas Edison said: <br />
> I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work

## Descriptions:
1. The programming language I use for the whole project: **Python**
2. I will comment the time and space complexity I use in each problem
3. Starting date: **03/22/22**

## Bottom Line: 
I hope everyone who comes across my project will have the dedication and 
courage to work on things you want for. 
Again, **DO NOT GIVE UP**
