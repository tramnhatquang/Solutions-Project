#PROBLEM-SOLVING SOLUTIONS PROJECT

## Motives and Goals: 
1. As a recent Math grad, I want to land in more technical interviews and 
   get great offers, especially from the FAANG and big tech companies
2. I plan to work on 5 LeetCode and 5 HackerRank problem per day 
3. Doing this project not only keeps me disciplined adn committed but also 
   hone my data structure and algorithm skills

## Descriptions:
1. The programming language I use for the whole project: **Python**
2. Ideally, I will put time and space complexity for each problem. Sometimes,
   I will forget so I try my best
3. Start date: **03/22/22**, and End date is infinite

## Bottom Line: 
I hope everyone who comes across my project will have the dedication and 
courage to work on things you want for. 
Again, **DO NOT GIVE UP**
