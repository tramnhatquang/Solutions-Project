		# keep track of the current longest length among the ones with
		# non-repeating characters TC for find every possible substrings is O(
		# n^2) TC to check if any substrings are the ones with non-repeating
		# characters is O(n) total TC: O(n^3), space: O(n)

		# longest_length = 0

		# Approach 2: Using the sliding window technique. We need to use a
		# hash map to keep track of both character and the last index of that
		# character we have so far. Whenever we have a duplicate character,
		# we'll shrink our sliding window to make sure that we only have
		# distinct characters within the sliding window

			# if the map already contains the 'right_char', shrink the window
			# from the beginning so that we have only one occurrence of
			# 'right_char'
			if right_char in char_index_map:
				# this is tricky; in the current window, we will not have any
				# 'right_char' after its previous index and if 'window_start'
				# is already ahead of the last index of 'right_char', we'll
				# keep 'window_start' window_start = max(window_start,
				# char_index_map[right_char] + 1)
				window_start = char_index_map[right_char] + 1

			# insert the 'right_char' into the map
			char_index_map[right_char] = window_end
			# remember the maximum length so far
			max_length = max(max_length, window_end - window_start + 1)
