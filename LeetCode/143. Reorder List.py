		# Algorithm:
		# 1. FInd the middle node of the LL. If the LL is odd, the middle node is the node in the middle. If the LL is even, the middle node is the second middle node in the LL.
		# 2. Reverse the second half of the LL, including the middle node
		# 3. Have two pointers, one points to the head, while the second one points to the middle node. Two pointers will move simutaneously and link to each other. We continue to do it until the second pointer's next is Null
